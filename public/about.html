      <h2><b>WHO ARE WE?</b></h2>
      <p><b>We are Bristol University's Opera Society!</b>
      <br><br>Our society provides many fantastic opportunities to get involved in the unique world of Opera, whether you are a singer, musician, or just an opera fanatic! We put on a multitude of events each year and are always keen to encourage people to get involved in all kinds of different ways.
      <br><br>Each year, we stage our annual main show, performed to the public, in March/April time. Past years have seen a range of different productions: from Mozart's <i>Don Giovanni</i> to Janacek's <i>The Cunning Little Vixen</i>.
      <br><br>When we're not performing on stage, we hold a number of smaller events. These include regular arias concerts and recitals, which give members other chances to perform, alumni masterclasses, opera screening socials, trips to opera houses, termly formals and Performing Arts nights out.
      <br><br>We are always on the lookout for new members; instrumentalists, singers, conductors, directors, producters or anyone who fancies trying something new - we will welcome you with open arms!
      <br><br></p>

      <p>Walter is a Second Year student of Classical Studies. He joined BOpS last year and directed Die Fledermaus in March 2022, and also went on to co-direct a sketch for a DramSoc and Spotlights showcase in June. Walter is directing BOpS’ 2023 production of Donizetti’s The Elixir of Love.
      <br>He has been involved in music, theatre and opera from a young age; as a performer, his credits in opera include Noye’s Fludde, L’Etoile and two new commissions: Belongings and Agreed at Glyndebourne opera house, where he was also a Junior Artist from 2018-19. Walter was a panellist on the youth jury for Glyndebourne and Sky Arts’ Opera Cup competition in March 2020.
      <br>He is immensely grateful to the society for being elected president and is excited to be working with a fantastic committee to continue to provide Bristol students with the opportunity of discovering and exploring the world of opera. He is committed to making opera a more accessible art form and wants BOpS to be a society that welcomes people to try out opera who have never had the opportunity to before, as well as to provide those who have previously to continue developing their talents.</p>

      <p>Nel is in second year and studies English lit. She's been in church and school choirs her whole life but discovered a love for opera through participation in productions with English National Opera and Garsington.

      <p>Io is in their third year studying Computer Science at Bristol, and their second year as BOpS' treasurer. In the past they participated in musicals in secondary school such as Joseph and Annie, and at University they have participated in three productions with BOpS now, including the online production the Magic Flute in 2021, Die Fledermaus in 2022 and Iolanthe in 2021, which they directed. Io has also been involved with MTB's 48 hour production of Heathers and long-form improv shows with Bristol Improv. This year Io is looking forward to directing BOpS' TB1 production of HMS Pinafore, getting to know the freshers, and spreading the good word of G&S! </p>

      <p>Peter is a third year physics and philosophy student, and (to take the edge off that) is also this year’s secretary of BOpS! They have been singing in choirs for most of their life, first as a chorister at St Johns in Cambridge and most recently in the Bristol university’s madrigal ensemble. However, their first experience with opera was last year’s BOpS performance of Fledermaus, which they joined just two weeks before opening night after someone had to drop out due to illness. Thanks to Walter’s brilliant directing and the help of the wonderful cast, it turned out to be one of the highlights of their year!</p>
